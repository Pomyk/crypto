```
I am saying the standard library should provide specialized implementations of an opinionated
small set of curves, not support for all possible curves. The latter belongs in a third-party
project (which can absolutely start from the stdlib code, as it's BSD licensed).
```

# Why?

You can use a golang lib that wraps a bunch of C headers from who knows where, or you can use this.

All you need to trust is the PR above.
